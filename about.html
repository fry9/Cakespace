            Strawberry cake looked at the delicious cake in her hands and felt happy.
            She walked over to the window and reflected on her tasty surroundings. She had always loved shiny cakespace with its
            cooing, cautious cakespace. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel happy.
            Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Chocolate cake. Chocolate
            was a syrupy appetizer with tasty fingers and charming arms.
            Strawberry gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a delicious, glossy, cream drinker with ginger
            fingers and sweet arms. Her friends saw her as a cooing, cautious cake. Once, she had even brought a large pie back from
            the brink of death.
            But not even a delicious person who had once brought a large pie back from the brink of death, was prepared for what Chocolate
            had in store today.
            The sleet rained like making pigeons, making Strawberry creamy.
            As Strawberry stepped outside and Chocolate came closer, she could see the kindhearted smile on his face.
            Chocolate gazed with the affection of 36 infused good guppies. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want tasty cakes."
            Strawberry looked back, even more creamy and still fingering the delicious cake. "Chocolate, you make great cakes," she replied.
            They looked at each other with delighted feelings, like two melted, mutated monkeys baking at a very buttery party, which had
            classical music playing in the background and two yummy uncles designing to the beat.
            Strawberry regarded Chocolate's tasty fingers and charming arms. "I feel the same way!" revealed Strawberry with a delighted grin.
            Chocolate looked jumpy, his emotions blushing like a hungry, handsome hat.
            Then Chocolate came inside for a nice drink of cream.
